# The unofficial CS:GO issue tracker

Recently, there has been much debate in the CS:GO community as to how responsive Valve should be to bugs, issues, etc. Many CS:GO players care about the game and want to contribute, and understandably, Valve is notorious for being a secretive company, with little feedback to the community on impending updates, road maps, etc.

While this repository is not intended to present any pressure on Valve or be a suggestion as to where to prioritize development, it seems as if an issue tracker may be a good way for the community to properly report bugs, comment on issues they're seeing, and then help other users in resolving issues they may have. As Valve fixes issues in future releases, issues can be closed and tracking users will be alerted as to the fix.

So let's start here and see if this helps the community properly formalize a list of issues, track updates, and improve the CS:GO experience. 

If you have never created a bug report before, the more detail the better. By creating detailed reports, other community users can help isolate exactly what is causing the problem, and help devise ways for fellow users to mitigate any problems. I've linked to a few resources to help teach great bug reporting for those who may be new to this:
